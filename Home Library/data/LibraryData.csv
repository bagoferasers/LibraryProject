The Alpha's Warlock ( Mismatched Mates Book 1 ),Eliot,Grayson,Romance,Fantasy/Werewolf/Gay/LGBTQ+/Magic/Warlock/Romance,"Cursed, mated, and in for the fight of their lives… Warlock Nate Hawthorne just wants a cup of coffee. Is that too much to ask? Apparently. Because instead of precious caffeine, all he gets is cursed by a pack of werewolves who want to use him for his magic. Now the only way to fix the damage is a mate bond to a grumpy and oh-so-sexy alpha in the rival pack, who happens to hate him. This is so not how he wanted to start his day. Ian Armitage never intended to take Nate as his mate. The Hawthorne family can’t be trusted. Ian knows that better than anyone. The fact that he’s lusted after the way-too-gorgeous man for years? Totally irrelevant. Ian’s just doing what is necessary to protect his pack. This whole mating arrangement has nothing to do with love and never will. That’s his story and he’s sticking to it. Nate and Ian will have to work together if they have any hope of staving off the pack’s enemies and averting disaster. That’s assuming they can stop arguing (and keep their hands off each other) long enough to save the day…",3,theAlphasWorlock.jpg,Kindle,FALSE,nodate,noname

Bigger Leaner Stronger: The Simple Science of Building the Ultimate Male Body,Michael,Matthews,Health,Health/Fitness/Workout,"Is this a bodybuilding book that can help you pack on brain-shrinking amounts of muscle in 30 days flat? No. Is it a fitness book full of dubious diet and exercise “hacks” and “shortcuts” for melting belly fat faster than a roided hornet? Absolutely not. But is it an exercise book (and nutrition book) that’ll show you exactly how to eat and exercise to gain 25-to-35 pounds of lean muscle and lose just as much fat (or even more)? Yes. And faster than you probably think possible. Because here’s the deal: Muscle building and fat loss aren’t nearly as complicated as you’ve been led to believe. You don't need to: Obsess over "clean eating" and avoiding “unhealthy” foods like sugar, meat, and bread. Some foods are more nutritious and should be eaten more frequently than others. That's it. You don't need to: Spend a couple hours in the gym every day grinding through punishing strength training workouts. Sweating buckets, getting really sore, training until bone-tired . . . all wholly overrated for gaining muscle and strength. You don't need to: Slog away on the treadmill. In fact, you don't need to do any cardio exercise at all to shed ugly belly fat and even get six-pack abs. Those are just a few of the harmful fitness lies and myths that keep guys from ever achieving the lean, muscular, and strong body they truly desire. And Bigger Leaner Stronger will teach you something that most men will never know: How to transform your body while eating the foods you like and doing a few challenging (but not grueling) strength training workouts per week. Oh and cardio exercise? Completely optional.",12,biggerLeanerStronger.jpg,Kindle,FALSE,nodate,noname

All Souls Near & Nigh ( Soulbound Book 2 ),Hailey,Turner,Fantasy,Fantasy/Romance/LGBTQ+/Sci-Fi/Fiction/Gay Romance/Magic/Werewolf/Crime/Demon/Immortal/NYC,"You can’t bargain with death if you’ve already sold your soul. Special Agent Patrick Collins has been reassigned by the Supernatural Operations Agency to New York City. Navigating his new relationship with Jonothon de Vere, the werewolf he’s now soulbound to, is nothing compared to dealing with territorial disputes between the vampires and werecreatures who call the five boroughs home. But the delicate treaties that have kept the preternatural world in check are fraying at the edges, and the fallout is spilling into the mundane world. Manhattan’s club scene is overrun with the vampire drug known as shine and the subways have become a dumping ground for bodies. When the dead are revealed as missing werecreatures, Patrick and Jono find themselves entangled in pack politics twisted by vampire machinations. Learning to trust each other comes with problems for both of them, and the gods with a stake in Patrick’s soul debt aren’t finished with him yet. Bound by promises they can’t break, Patrick and Jono must find a way to survive a threat that takes no prisoners and is stalking them relentlessly through the city streets. Old and new betrayals are coming home to roost but the truth—buried in blood—is more poisonous than the lies being spun. Trying to outrun death is a nightmare—one Patrick may never wake up from.
