The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,John,Bolton,Politics,Politics/Trump/White House/Republican/President/National Security/West Wing/United States/USA,"The result is a White House memoir that is the most comprehensive and substantial account of the Trump Administration, and one of the few to date by a top-level official. With almost daily access to the President, John Bolton has produced a precise rendering of his days in and around the Oval Office. What Bolton saw astonished him: a President for whom getting reelected was the only thing that mattered, even if it meant endangering or weakening the nation. 'I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasnâ€™t driven by reelection calculations,' he writes. In fact, he argues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trumpâ€™s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policyâ€”and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them. He shows a President addicted to chaos, who embraced our enemies and spurned our friends, and was deeply suspicious of his own government. In Boltonâ€™s telling, all this helped put Trump on the bizarre road to impeachment. 'The differences between this presidency and previous ones I had served were stunning,' writes Bolton, who worked for Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43. He discovered a President who thought foreign policy is like closing a real estate dealâ€”about personal relationships, made-for-TV showmanship, and advancing his own interests. As a result, the US lost an opportunity to confront its deepening threats, and in cases like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea ended up in a more vulnerable place. Boltonâ€™s account starts with his long march to the West Wing as Trump and others woo him for the National Security job. The minute he lands, he has to deal with Syriaâ€™s chemical attack on the city of Douma, and the crises after that never stop. As he writes in the opening pages, 'If you donâ€™t like turmoil, uncertainty, and riskâ€”all the while being constantly overwhelmed with information, decisions to be made, and sheer amount of workâ€”and enlivened by international and domestic personality and ego conflicts beyond description, try something else.' The turmoil, conflicts, and egos are all thereâ€”from the upheaval in Venezuela, to the erratic and manipulative moves of North Koreaâ€™s Kim Jong Un, to the showdowns at the G7 summits, the calculated warmongering by Iran, the crazy plan to bring the Taliban to Camp David, and the placating of an authoritarian China that ultimately exposed the world to its lethal lies. But this seasoned public servant also has a great eye for the Washington inside game, and his story is full of wit and wry humor about how he saw it played.",17,theRoomWhereItHappened.jpg,Kindle,FALSE,nodate,noname

The Case for Space: How the Revolution in Spaceflight Opens Up a Future of Limitless Possibility,Robert,Zubrin,Space,Space/Science/Moon/Mars/Exploration/Rockets/Spaceflight/Future,"A noted space expert explains the current revolution in spaceflight, where it leads, and why we need it. A new space race has begun. But the rivals in this case are not superpowers but competing entrepreneurs. These daring pioneers are creating a revolution in spaceflight that promises to transform the near future. Astronautical engineer Robert Zubrin spells out the potential of these new developments in an engrossing narrative that is visionary yet grounded by a deep understanding of the practical challenges.Fueled by the combined expertise of the old aerospace industry and the talents of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, spaceflight is becoming cheaper. The new generation of space explorers has already achieved a major breakthrough by creating reusable rockets. Zubrin foresees more rapid innovation, including global travel from any point on Earth to another in an hour or less; orbital hotels; moon bases with incredible space observatories; human settlements on Mars, the asteroids, and the moons of the outer planets; and then, breaking all limits, pushing onward to the stars.Zubrin shows how projects that sound like science fiction can actually become reality. But beyond the how, he makes an even more compelling case for why we need to do this--to increase our knowledge of the universe, to make unforeseen discoveries on new frontiers, to harness the natural resources of other planets, to safeguard Earth from stray asteroids, to ensure the future of humanity by expanding beyond its home base, and to protect us from being catastrophically set against each other by the false belief that there isn't enough for all.",20,theCaseForSpace.jpg,Kindle,FALSE,nodate,noname

Special Agent Patrick Collins has been reassigned by the Supernatural Operations Agency to New York City. Navigating his new relationship with Jonothon de Vere, the werewolf heâ€™s now soulbound to, is nothing compared to dealing with territorial disputes between the vampires and werecreatures who call the five boroughs home. But the delicate treaties that have kept the preternatural world in check are fraying at the edges, and the fallout is spilling into the mundane world. Manhattanâ€™s club scene is overrun with the vampire drug known as shine and the subways have become a dumping ground for bodies. When the dead are revealed as missing werecreatures, Patrick and Jono find themselves entangled in pack politics twisted by vampire machinations. Learning to trust each other comes with problems for both of them, and the gods with a stake in Patrickâ€™s soul debt arenâ€™t finished with him yet. Bound by promises they canâ€™t break, Patrick and Jono must find a way to survive a threat that takes no prisoners and is stalking them relentlessly through the city streets. Old and new betrayals are coming home to roost but the truthâ€”buried in bloodâ€”is more poisonous than the lies being spun. Trying to outrun death is a nightmareâ€”one Patrick may never wake up from. Please see the disclaimer at the beginning of the book for content some readers may find triggering.
