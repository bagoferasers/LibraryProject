The Hobbit : or There and Back Again,Tolkien,J.R.R. ,Fantasy,Fantasy/Dragons/Magic/Elves/Dwarfs/Trolls/Goblins/Adventure,"A great modern classic and the prelude to The Lord of The Rings. From J.R.R. Tolkien's own description for the original edition: ""If you care for journeys there and back, out of the comfortable Western world, over the edge of the Wild, and home again, and can take an interest in a humble hero ( blessed with a little wisdom and a little courage and considerable good luck ), here is a record of such a journey and such a traveler. . . . In following the path of this humble adventurer, you will learn by the way ( as he did ) - if you do not already know about these things - much about trolls, goblins, dwarves, and elves, and get some glimpses into the history and politics of a neglected but important period."""
The Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring,Tolkien,J.R.R. ,Fantasy,Fantasy/Dragons/Magic/Elves/Dwarfs/Trolls/Goblins/Adventure,"The dark, fearsome Ringwraiths were searching for a hobbit. Frodo Baggins knew they were seeking him and the Ring he bore - the Ring of Power that would enable evil Sauron to destroy all that was good in Middle-Earth. Now it is up to Frodo and his faithful servant, Sam, with a small band of companions, to carry the Ring to the one place it could be destroyed - Mount Doom, in the very center of Sauron's dark kingdom."
